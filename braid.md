## Project Description
Braid is trying to fix science publishing by reducing gatekeeping and increasing open access. 
We want to be a place where scientists can upload their papers (to IPFS), review the work of their peers, and be compensated for both.

## Project Status
Brainstorming/Under Development

The seed for Braid was a hackathon project called Paperfax. Paperfax began at EthOnline 2021 where we quickly built a preliminary version of our dapp which enables file uploads to IPFS.
Our next steps include increasing community development and engagement, improvement of the UI, development of an incentive protocol, and considering need for product marketing. 
We may change our name and/or join an accelerator program.

## Target Audience
Our project is primarily targeted towards scholars and/or scientists who are used to publishing their papers in traditional journals. 
By leveraging IPFS, we provice scholars a permanent way to prove that they were first to an idea or breakthrough. 
By leveraging cryptocurrency, we hope to create peer-to-peer incentive to review work.
